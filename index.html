                <p>On a stormy Tuesday, Olivia works her second job, eats in the breakroom, and video calls her mom. A story about small joys and bigger worries in a city that doesnâ€™t wait.</p>

                <h2>The Dishwasher Poet</h2>
                <p>By night, Marco scrubs plates at a Midtown restaurant. By day, he writes verses in the margins of receipts. A quiet portrait of rhythm, resilience, and dreams between shifts.</p>
