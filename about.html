        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Why do I look like my father if I hate him?</strong><br>
        What is it like to beg for money on the streets of New York?<br>
        What does a typical day in a "gay conversion camp" look like?<br>
        How does a private school break your mind and destroy your health?</p>

        <p>We live in the <strong>era of post-truth</strong>. Believing the words on the other side of the screen is no longer possible.<br>
        We log in and are bombarded with <strong>pre-packaged headlines, curated images, and articles that are designed to convince us of a single perspective.</strong><br>
        Stories that once mattered, spaces that once belonged to real people—<strong>hollowed out, repurposed, and sold back to us as propaganda.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>As the editors of Karavan, we are fucking tired.</strong><br>
        If you're reading this—know that <strong>we are exhausted.</strong></p>

        <p>We miss the internet <strong>as it used to be.</strong><br>
        And we want to bring back what it was made for—you.</p>

        <p>With your <strong>ideas, fears, struggles</strong>—but most importantly, <strong>with your opinion.</strong></p>

        <p>Every article you see here is a story told by a real person.<br>
        No hidden sponsors. No agendas. No editorial "guidelines."<br>
        We protect anonymity. We protect our writers.</p>

        <p><strong>Let go.</strong><br>
        <strong>Listen to others without demanding answers.</strong> Take in their experiences without needing something in return.<br>
        And if you ever feel like sharing—send us your story.</p>

        <h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
        <p>1. For now, <strong>please avoid registering on the site or leaving comments that could expose your identity.</strong></p>
        <p>2. Each post has a view counter. <strong>We do not track personal data or store information on who viewed what.</strong></p>
        <p>3. <strong>For philosophical discussions or to submit your own story, write to us here (FORM).</strong> Be kind. A real person will read your message.</p>

        <p><strong>Stay strong in these times.</strong></p>
