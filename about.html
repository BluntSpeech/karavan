    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Why do I look like my father if I hate him?</p>
        <p>What is it like to beg for money on the streets of New York?</p>
        <p>What does a typical day in a "gay conversion camp" look like?</p>
        <p>How does a private school break your mind and destroy your health?</p>

        <p>We live in the era of post-truth. Believing the words on the other side of the screen is no longer possible. We log in and are bombarded with pre-packaged headlines, curated images, and articles that are designed to convince us of a single perspective. Stories that once mattered, spaces that once belonged to real people—hollowed out, repurposed, and sold back to us as propaganda.</p>

        <p>As the editors of Karavan, we are fucking tired. If you're reading this—know that we are exhausted.</p>

        <p>We miss the internet as it used to be. And we want to bring back what it was made for—you.</p>

        <p>With your ideas, fears, struggles—but most importantly, with your opinion.</p>

        <p>Every article you see here is a story told by a real person. No hidden sponsors. No agendas. No editorial "guidelines." We protect anonymity. We protect our writers.</p>

        <p>Let go. Listen to others without demanding answers. Take in their experiences without needing something in return. And if you ever feel like sharing—send us your story.</p>

        <h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
        <p>1. For now, please avoid leaving comments that could expose your identity.</p>
        <p>2. Each post has a view counter. We do not track personal data or store information on who viewed what.</p>
        <p>3. For philosophical discussions or to submit your own story, write to us here (FORM). Be kind. A real person will read your message.</p>

        <p>More on privacy and opinion protection HERE (link).</p>
        <p>Stay strong in these times.</p>
