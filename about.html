        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Why do I look like my father if I hate him?</span><br>
        What does a typical day in a "gay conversion camp" look like?<br>
        How does a private school break your mind and destroy your health?</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">We live in the era of post-truth</span>. Believing the words on the other side of the screen is no longer possible. We are bombarded with pre-packaged headlines, curated images, and articles that are designed to convince us of a perspective <span class="highlight">they want you to believe.</span><span class="highlight">.</span></p>

        <p>Stories that once mattered, spaces that once belonged to real people—hollowed out, repackaged, and sold back to us as propaganda.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">As the editors of Karavan, we are fucking tired.</span></p>
        
        <p>We miss the internet as it used to be.<br>
        And we want to bring back what it was made for—<span class="highlight">you</span>.</p>

        <p>Every article you see here is a story told by a real person. <br>
        No hidden sponsors. No agendas. No editorial "guidelines."<br>
        We protect anonymity. We protect our writers.</p>

        <p>Listen to others without demanding answers.<br> 
        Take in their experiences without feeling the need to give anything in return.<br>
        And if you ever feel like sharing—send us your story.</p>

        <h2 class="highlight">IMPORTANT</h2>
        <p>1. Please avoid leaving comments that could expose your identity.</p>
        <p>2. Each post has a view counter. We do not track personal data or store info on who viewed what.</p>
        <p>3. For philosophical discussions or to submit your own story, write to us <span class="highlight">here</span>. Be kind. A real person will read your message.</p>
